A Tactical Viewpoint
Real Madrid could also go 4-2-4 in a bid to start the game by roughing up Arsenal’s flanks. Mbappé and Vinícius will hunt the infrequent counterattack, and Valverde and Modric will try to assert control of the midfield. The fighting will be high-pressure and literal.
Yet Arsenal do spend more time than you’d imagine absorbing pressure and existing marginally out of possession, and Saka and Martinelli both do love an outing in the break. Set pieces remain a crucial weapon, placing rice and parley in front.

Forecasts and Chances
Real Madrid's at 6/1 to the left; Arsenal's at 1/7 to advance.
Match odds: Real Madrid 7/10 | Arsenal 7/2 | Draw 3/1.
In the waning moments of a match, this isn’t over until it is because we know what sort of late-game magic Real Madrid is capable of at the Bernabéu. Which team theoretically should be the victor? Arsenal.
The next time the rematch is played at the Bernabéu Arsenal will at least be at the other end of the spectrum of comfort, as they can return to Gunners hq with a healthy three-nil aggregate. And with most of Real Madrid's players not getting the cut, it will require a monumental effort from the team to even make the last four of the tournament. Instead they will have a chance to play in the far more exotic Champions League final, after Arsenal had been unbeaten and unbroken in Europe until now
