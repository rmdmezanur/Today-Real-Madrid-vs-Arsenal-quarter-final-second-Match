A Tactical Viewpoint
Real Madridâ€‚could also go 4-2-4 in a bid to start the game by roughing up Arsenalâ€™s flanks. MbappÃ© and VinÃ­cius will hunt the infrequent counterattack, and Valverde and Modric will try to assert controlâ€‚of the midfield. The fighting will be high-pressureâ€‚and literal.
Yet Arsenal do spend more time than youâ€™d imagine absorbing pressure and existing marginally out of possession, and Saka and Martinelli both do loveâ€‚an outing in the break. Set piecesâ€‚remain a crucial weapon, placing rice and parley in front.

Forecasts and Chances
Realâ€‚Madrid's at 6/1 to the left; Arsenal's at 1/7 to advance.
Match odds: Real Madrid 7/10 | Arsenal 7/2 | Drawâ€‚3/1.
In the waning moments of aâ€‚match, this isnâ€™t over until it is because we know what sort of late-game magic Real Madrid is capable of at the BernabÃ©u. Which team theoreticallyâ€‚should be the victor? Arsenal.
The next time the rematch is played at the BernabÃ©u Arsenal will at least be at the other end of the spectrum of comfort, as they can return toâ€‚Gunners hq with a healthy three-nil aggregate. And with most ofâ€‚Real Madrid's players not getting the cut, it will require a monumental effort from the team to even make the last four of the tournament. Instead they will have a chance to play in the far more exotic Champions League final, afterâ€‚Arsenal had been unbeaten and unbroken in Europe until now
